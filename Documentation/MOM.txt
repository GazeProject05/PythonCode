	Zain -> Emails/In contatct with Johannes
	Rahul -> Scheduling Meetings
3. Future tasks divison.  


28.04.19

1. Discussed and understood multivariate gaussian distribution
2. Decided to no work with time data for each column.
3. After Sediq's departure: work was devided in following manner. 
	TeamLead: Devesh
	Communication: Zain
	Scheduling team meets: Rahul 

New Tasks: TJ (Data), cut off data after 10 mins.
	   Madhu and Zain, find final model for each classification (Scanning, Reading, Skimming, Unknown).    		
	   Madhu -> Pupil Size
	   Zain -> x,y pixel position (gaze gradient)
           
	   Devesh and Rahul -> Introduction, Literature Survey, Methodology

Go and look if timestamps are in sync for each and every individual (for both annotations).

Looking in data to understand the how *out of sync* data is??


Ask Johannes: about sync data? 	    	
	      {assuming two reading annotations diagree by 2 rows, how do we deal with this. 
		 discard the disagrement, keep it, or keep half.}	 	
	
Note for Zain: StudioEvent---->Look for value 'ScreenRecStarted'

	Pupil Size Distribution: How to use the type of distribution we obtained for the pupil size?? 
				chi square testing

	Documentation in progress.

	[TJ]
	Add: Time (hh:mm:ss)
	     StudioEventIndex_A (rename)
